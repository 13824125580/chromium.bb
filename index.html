<h2>Branches</h2>
<p>This section will describe each branch and what changes they introduce.
Note that some of these changes have been contributed upstream.  Our intention
is to contribute as many changes upstream as possible so that we do not have to
maintain these branches in our repository.</p>
<p>However, we realize that some of these changes are made in order to adjust
the behavior of our own product, and may not be desirable/applicable to the
general web.  For example, the way the
<code>&lt;delete&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;backspace&gt;</code> keys work inside
table cells, the way indenting/outdenting of list items work, etc.  Therefore,
we will probably not be able to send <em>everything</em> upstream.</p>

<div id="activebranches">

<h3><a name="bugfix-anonymousPseudoStyle">bugfix/anonymousPseudoStyle</a> (Shezan Baig; D39210769; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110648">110648</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/anonymousPseudoStyle.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
The selection gaps after "hello" and "world" do not honor the selection
background color specified in the CSS.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-badquerycommand">bugfix/badquerycommand</a> (Shezan Baig; D32128551)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/badquerycommand.html">this link</a> in Chrome, click
the yellow div and hit <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code> a bunch of times. Then
<code>&lt;shift&gt;</code>+<code>&lt;up&gt;</code> a bunch of times. Each time
you press <code>&lt;up&gt;</code>, the result of
<code>queryCommandValue('bold')</code> changes inconsistently.<p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-caretPosition">bugfix/caretPosition</a> (Tianyin Zhang; D38913437, D38277785)</h3>
<p>This branch consists of multiple fixes that were merged together:</p>
<ul><li><b>fixUndoSpellCaretPos (D38913437)</b><br>
    Open <a href="repros/fixUndoSpellCaretPos.html">this link</a> in test shell. Enable AsynchronousSpellCheckEnabled bit, Spellchecker, and AutoCorrection. Assuming the Spellchecker will autocorrect all the 'tset' into 'test' and will auto capitalize first letter in a sentence which happens before the autocorrect. Now type 'tset' in the following DIV and hit space. Autocapitalize and autocorrection will happen in order and text gets replaced by 'Test '. Then hit 'Ctrl + Z' to undo this change. The first time it undid the autocorrection and produce 'Tset '. However the cursor position is not after the space but after the 't'. Hit space again we have 'tset ' and the cursor position is after the space. The correct behavior is that the cursor position should always be after the space when undo.
    </li>
    <li><b>restoreCaretPosition (D38277785)</b><br>
    Open <a href="repros/restoreCaretPosition.html">this link</a> in test_shell. Enable AsynchronousSpellCheckEnabled bit, Spellchecker, and AutoCorrection. Assuming the Spellchecker will autocorrect all the 'tst' into 'test'. Now type really fast in the DIV[contenteditable] below. Make sure 'tsts' is typed multiple times.  Note that the caret position should always be at the end of this text flow.  Due to a bug in Editor, this could break when user types fast because it would reset the caret position after a replacement under some cases.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cellInMulticol">bugfix/cellInMulticol</a> (Shezan Baig; D34079255)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/cellInMulticol.html">this link</a> in Chrome and keep
resizing the window. You will see that the table cells get split when they
reach column boundaries.</p>
<p>This is a rather complicated patch and requires a bunch of additional work
before it can be sent upstream.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-checkSpellcheckAttrBeforeMark">bugfix/checkSpellcheckAttrBeforeMark</a> (Tianyin Zhang; D37544856)</h3>
<p>This patch fixed a bug where text under elements having spellcheck attribute set to false got spellchecked. To see the bug, open <a href="repros/checkSpellcheckAttrBeforeMark.html">This Link</a> in Chrome</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-clearDragCaret">bugfix/clearDragCaret</a> (Shezan Baig; D31916022)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/clearDragCaret.html">this link</a> in Chrome, then
select some text from another tab, and try to drag it into the editable div.
Before you drop, you will see a caret at the place where the text should go.
When you drop however, <code>event.preventDefault()</code> is called, so the
text does not get inserted. However, the drag caret remains visible.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cleartypecanvas">bugfix/cleartypecanvas</a> (Shezan Baig; D32281407; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86776">86776</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/cleartypecanvas">this link</a> in Chrome, and notice
that the canvas element does not use ClearType fonts even though
<code>subpixel-antialiased</code> is used.</p> <p>Note that when painting to an
<code>ImageBuffer</code>, Chromium disables ClearType even if it is the default
on the system.  However, in our case, we are explicitly requesting it in the
document, so this change makes Chromium honor the
<code>-webkit-font-smoothing</code> setting if it is requested explicitly.</p>
<p>Note that there are two distinct changes introduced by this branch:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>-webkit-font-smoothing</code> setting has no effect in Windows for Skia.
This is the change that is being tracked upstream by WebKit bug
<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86776">86776</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't disable ClearType on <code>ImageBuffer</code> if it was explicitly requested.
This is not yet being tracked upstream.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="bugfix-ctrlShiftRight">bugfix/ctrlShiftRight</a> (Claudio Saavedra &lt;csaavedra@igalia.com&gt;; D37320855; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110487">110487</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/ctrlShiftRight.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and use
Ctrl+Shift+Right to extend selection to the next word.  Without this branch,
you will notice that the space after words is not included in the
selection.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cursorContext">bugfix/cursorContext</a> (Shezan Baig; D35952365)</h3>
<p>It is somewhat hard to reproduce, the window height needs to be just about
right.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/cursorContext.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and hit
Enter until the cursor is at the last possible line where the scrollbar does
not appear.  Make sure there is just enough space for about half a line
more.</p>
<p>Now keep typing on this line, letting it word-wrap which causes the scrollbar
to appear.  Keep doing this for a few lines.  You will notice that on some
lines (usually the second or the third, then every alternating line after
that), the scrollbar does not scroll down completely.</p>
<p>In our product, there is an overlay around the RTE of about a couple of pixels.
The purpose of the padding on the contenteditable was to prevent this overlay
from covering the text.  However, since the bottom of the text was right
against the border of the <code>content-editable</code>, this was causing the
descent of some characters to be obscured.</p>
<p>We "fixed" this in this branch by inflating the reveal rect by about half the
cursor height, showing more "context" when moving up and down in a scrollable
contenteditable.  However, a proper fix would be to make the last line scroll
completely, taking the padding into account.  We haven't gotten around to this
yet.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-deleteBackspace">bugfix/deleteBackspace</a> (Shezan Baig; D32947240)</h3>
<p>This branch consists of multiple fixes that were merged together:</p>
<ul><li><b>backspaceIntoTable (D32947240)</b><br>
    Open <a href="repros/backspaceIntoTable.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
    put the cursor between 'T' and 'e' in "Testing", and hit backspace twice.  The
    rest of the text will go into the last cell.
    </li>
    <li><b>nonemptycellbackspace</b><br>
    Open <a href="repros/nonemptycellbackspace.html">this link</a> in Chrome,
    and put the cursor in the beginning of the second or third cell and start
    backspacing.  Note that the issue does not happen when the cell is
    empty.<br>
    <i>Note that this has been fixed upstream since the
    <code>28.0.1500.95</code> snapshot.</i>
    </li>
    <li><b>nonemptycelldelete</b><br>
    Open <a href="repros/nonemptycelldelete.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
    put the cursor at the end of the first cell, after the 'c' and start deleting.
    The table in the next cell will be highlighted on the first press, and deleted
    on the second press.  Note that the issue does not happen when the cell is
    empty.<br>
    <i>Note that this has been fixed upstream since the
    <code>28.0.1500.95</code> snapshot.</i>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="bugfix-doubleindent">bugfix/doubleindent</a> (Shezan Baig; D32165963)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/doubleindent.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
position the cursor before the logo.  Indent the image twice, then outdent the
image twice.  There will be one level of indentation still left.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-emptycellcaret">bugfix/emptycellcaret</a> (Shezan Baig; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85385">85385</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/emptycellcaret.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and put
the caret inside an empty table cell.  The caret's <code>y-position</code> is
outside the <code>table-cell</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-iframeZoom">bugfix/iframeZoom</a> (Shezan Baig; D34484409)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/iframeZoom.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and zoom the
page in and out.  The content outside the <code>iframe</code> zooms, but the
content inside the <code>iframe</code> does not zoom.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-indentpre">bugfix/indentpre</a> (Shezan Baig; D31922188)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/indentpre.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The "Hello"
text will be selected on load.  Each time you indent the text, the "Hello" will
get duplicated.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-inputElementLayoutFix">bugfix/inputElementLayoutFix</a> (Zhen Yin; D43432726)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/inputElementLayoutFix.html">this link</a> in
test_shell.  Press the two buttons.  The text in the input field
disappears.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-justifyprewrap">bugfix/justifyprewrap</a> (Shezan Baig; D31916947; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84448">84448</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/justifyprewrap.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
second paragraph will not be justified, even though
<code>text-align:justify</code> is specified.</p>
<p>There is an upstream ticket for this issue, but it calls for a much more
comprehensive fix than what was done in this branch.  In this branch, we just
enable the existing justification logic in elements that have
<code>whitespace:pre-wrap</code> specified, but the upstream ticket calls for
modification to the justification logic itself to match how Microsoft Word
software works.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-listifySpans">bugfix/listifySpans</a> (Shezan Baig; D37507315)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/listifySpans.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The second
and third list items will be selected.  Click on the <code>OL</code> button to
convert these items to an ordered list.  The second and third list items get
placed into separate lists, but they should be on the same list.  Note that
this doesn't happen if the first and second items are selected instead.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-noBRAtStartOfPara">bugfix/noBRAtStartOfPara</a> (Shezan Baig; D36813987)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/noBRAtStartOfPara.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
contents of the table will be selected on load.  Hit the "List" button multiple
times.  Each click executes the <code>insertOrderedList</code> command.</p>
<p>On every second click, the table will move down.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-nonWindowContexts">bugfix/nonWindowContexts</a> (Shezan Baig)</h3>
<p>Note: This branch has been miscategorized as a bugfix, it is actually a feature
that we wanted specifically for our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch removes the assumption that every V8 context has a <code>DOMWindow</code>
associated with it.  This is necessary for our product because we have multiple
V8 contexts living in the same process that need to share data with each other.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-outdentWithBR">bugfix/outdentWithBR</a> (Shezan Baig; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92130">92130</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/outdentWithBR.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
indented block will be highlighted on load.  Click on the <code>OUTDENT</code>
button.  There are now a bunch of empty lines added in between.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-removeSpellingMarker">bugfix/removeSpellingMarker</a> (Tianyin Zhang; D38695085;)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/removeSpellingMarker.html">this link</a> in chrome, place the cursor inside the contenteditable and make sure some mispelling markers show up. Then click on the button to switch the contenteditable to false. Note that the misspelling markers aren't removed. </p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-scrollClipRect">bugfix/scrollClipRect</a> (Shezan Baig; D32861389)</h3>
<p>This bug is somewhat hard to reproduce, the window size needs to be just
about right.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/scrollClipRect.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
resize the window so that new outer scrollbars appear over the existing
scrollbars of the iframe.  Then resize it just a little smaller.  Then use the
mouse wheel to scroll the contents of the iframe.</p>
<p>If the window is sized just right, you will see that only a portion of the
iframe scrolls.  This is because the clipRect is not being calculated correctly
due to the scale transform being applied.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-scrollOverflowHidden">bugfix/scrollOverflowHidden</a> (Antonio Gomes <tonikitoo@webkit.org>; D42789626; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119760">119760</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/scrollOverflowHidden.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
click inside the "abcdef" entry, and drag to the far right.  The elements will
start scrolling unexpectedly.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-selrectantialias">bugfix/selrectantialias</a> (Shezan Baig; D32113976; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=87157">87157</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/selrectantialias.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  You
will see "gaps" between the lines and the spans on the first line.</p>
<p>The issue is that the selection highlight is drawn for each text run with
anti-aliasing on.  This causes "gaps" to appear around the edges where the
filled rects got blended.  The solution was to simply turn off anti-aliasing
when filling selection rects.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-singleCellDelete">bugfix/singleCellDelete</a> (Shezan Baig; D37576223)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/singleCellDelete.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
delete the text in the single table cell.  The entire table will get deleted,
but we only expect the text inside the cell to be deleted.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-tooltip_refresh">bugfix/tooltip_refresh</a> (Shezan Baig; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84375">84375</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/tooltip_refresh.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  Each
line has a tooltip set.  However, when the first tooltip shows up, and you move
the mouse away from it, it doesn't move the tooltip to the element where the
mouse is.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-blpwtk2">feature/blpwtk2</a> (Multiple Authors)</h3>
<p>This is our chromium embedding layer.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-bbEnhancements">feature/bbEnhancements</a> (Lilit Darbinyan)</h3>
<p>These are extensions to the Web platform that we use in our products.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-caretColor">feature/caretColor</a> (Claudio Saavedra &lt;csaavedra@igalia.com&gt;; D38294226)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>We needed to be able to modify the caret color independently of the font
color.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/caretColor.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  With this
patch, the caret color in the entry fields will be as specified, otherwise they
will be just black.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-colorDocumentMarkers">feature/colorDocumentMarkers</a> (Shezan Baig; D32415776)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>We needed extra control of the color of the document markers (i.e. the
squiggly lines for spelling errors etc).  WebKit hardcodes spelling errors to
red, grammar errors to green.  This branch makes it possible for us to specify
the color from the document.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/colorDocumentMarkers.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
With this patch, the mis-spelled words will be underlined in the specified
colors.</p>
<p>TODO: make this a CSS property instead of a DOM attribute.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-customSandboxLevels">feature/customSandboxLevels</a> (Tomy Jacob)</h3>
<p>These are extensions to the different sandboxing levels provided by the
Chromium sandbox library.  These levels are used by internal apps.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-fileEnhancements">feature/fileEnhancements</a> (Shezan Baig; D40335184)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>We needed to expose the full path to a dragged file object.  Open
<a href="repros/fileEnhancements.html">this link</a>, and drag some files from
Windows Explorer into the page.  The DragOver and Drop events should print out
the full path to the file.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-indentOutdentBlock">feature/indentOutdentBlock</a> (Shezan Baig; D39558769)</h3>
<p>This is a complete reimplementation of the "Indent" and "Outdent" algorithm,
called "IndentBlock" and "OutdentBlock".  Instead of cloning paragraphs, and
deleting the old paragraphs, this algorithm just moves blocks in and out of
blockquotes.  Also, it operates on blocks of text, instead of paragraphs.  This
is similar to how MSWord works.</p>
<p>The following links can be used to compare the behavior when this branch is
applied, and when it isn't (e.g. with upstream Chrome):</p>
<ul><li>open <a href="repros/indentOutdentBlock_1.html">this link</a> and just
    play around comparing behavior</li>
    <li>open <a href="repros/indentOutdentBlock_2.html">this link</a> and
    compare</li>
    <li>open <a href="repros/indentOutdentBlock_3.html">this link</a> and
    compare</li>
    <li>open <a href="repros/indentOutdentBlock_4.html">this link</a> and
    compare</li>
    <li>open <a href="repros/indentOutdentBlock_5.html">this link</a> and
    compare</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="feature-insertHTMLNested">feature/insertHTMLNested</a> (Shezan Baig; D37136356)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>We needed to modify the behavior of the <code>InsertHTML</code> command.
The WebKit behavior is to prevent the inserted HTML from being nested inside
style spans.  This branch adds <code>InsertHTMLNested</code> command that
allows the HTML to be nested inside style spans.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/insertHTMLNested.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  With
this patch, the "Insert HTML Nested" button works to preserve the font setting.
The default "Insert HTML" button doesn't preserve it.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-listMarkerEnhancements">feature/listMarkerEnhancements</a> (Shezan Baig; D37088493; D32534047; D32422051; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21709">21709</a>)</h3>
<p>This branch makes a bunch of enhancements to list markers that were needed
in our product, so it is unlikely that many of them will be sent upstream.</p>
<p>The following changes are included in this branch:
<ul>
    <li><b>Fixed alignment for list markers</b><br/>
    Open <a href="repros/listMarkerAlignment.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
    The  list markers are all left-aligned, even though the second and third
    <code>li</code> elements are not.  This particular change may be able to
    upstream because there is already a WebKit bug report for it.
    </li>
    <li><b>The font used for the list marker will be the same as the first
        character in the list item.</b><br/>
    Open <a href="repros/listMarkerFont.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
    list item will be selected.  When you click <code>BIGGER</code> or
    <code>SMALLER</code> to change the font size, the list marker's font does
    not change with it.  In our product, we wanted the list marker's font to
    match the first character in the list item.
    </li>
    <li><b>The list markers are not highlighted when the list item is
        selected</b><br/>
    This matches the behavior in Firefox and Microsoft Word software.<br/>
    Open <a href="repros/listMarkerSelection.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
    Notice that the list markers are highlighted.  Additionally, notice that
    the list marker highlight does not honor the <code>::selection</code>
    background color specified in the stylesheet.  In our product, we didn't
    want the list markers to be highlighted when selected.
    </li>
    <li><b>Change layout of list items and list markers</b><br/>
    The way list elements and list items are laid out has been changed so that,
    instead of <code>OL</code>/<code>UL</code> elements having 40px padding,
    the <code>LI</code> elements will receive an additional (intrinsic) margin
    equivalent to the width of the list marker.  This matches more closely what
    other software like Microsoft Word does, and also prevents issues like
    <a href="repros/listMarkerEnhancements1.html">this link</a> where the list
    marker gets pushed outside the page.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>

<h3><a name="feature-nColumnSpan">feature/nColumnSpan</a> (Shezan Baig; D33399541, D36821222)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>When using the multicolumn feature, there is a way to make an element span
across all columns (<code>-webkit-column-span: all</code>).</p>
<p>However, we needed a way to span across a specified number of columns, (e.g.
<code>-webkit-column-span: 2</code>).  Once CSS Regions have matured (WebKit
bug <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57312">57312</a>), we
should be able to use Regions to achieve this effect, then we can get rid of
this branch.  However, we needed this one specific feature immediately, so this
branch just hacks it in.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/nColumnSpan.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  With this
patch applied, the title will occupy two columns.  The button allows toggling
between two and three columns.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-preserveSelDirection">feature/preserveSelDirection</a> (Shezan Baig; D36076457)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch makes it so that when text is selected inside a contenteditable,
and then a style is applied on that text, the original selection direction
would be preserved.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/preserveSelDirection.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
With this patch applied, the anchor offset would be 5 positions higher than the
focus offset.  Without the patch, the anchor offset and focus offset will be
switched.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-setDataNoRelayout">feature/setDataNoRelayout</a> (Shezan Baig; D42070031)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>There are situations where we want to update a span, and because we know the
span is of a fixed size, we don't want the new text to trigger a relayout.  For
this, we introduced a new method on text nodes "bbSetDataNoRelayout".</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/setDataNoRelayout.html">this link</a> in Chrome (may
take a while to finish loading).  With this patch applied, there will be a
noticable difference in the time taken to execute the button click, depending
on whether the "norelayout" checkbox is enabled or disabled.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-tableEditing">feature/tableEditing</a> (Shezan Baig; D37611655)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>Right now, this branch consists of changes to the way text highlighting
works.  In upstream Chrome, the left and right side of text are highlighted
when the selection extends to the previous and next lines.  These are the
"selection gaps" that WebKit tries to highlight.</p>
<p>For our product, we just want the text to be highlighted.  So we disable the
left and right selection gaps.  However, we maintain the top and bottom
selection gaps (fixing a few bugs along the way).  We also maintain a slight
selection gap at the end of the lines in editable text, to indicate that the
line-ending has been selected.</p>
<p>However, for tables, we do highlight the left and right sides if the
selection extends outside the table cell.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/tableEditing.html">this link</a> and compare the
behavior with and without the patch applied.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-wordBreakKeepAll">feature/wordBreakKeepAll</a> (Shezan Baig; D41784575; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43917">43917</a>)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.  Note: we may upstream <code>word-break: keep-all</code>,
but probably not <code>word-break: -bb-keep-all-if-korean</code>.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/wordBreakKeepAll.html">this link</a> and resize the
window, and observe the word-break between Korean, Japanese, and English
text.</p>
