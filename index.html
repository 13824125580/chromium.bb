<h3><a name="bugfix-backspaceIntoTable">bugfix/backspaceIntoTable</a> (Shezan Baig; D32947240)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/backspaceIntoTable.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
put the cursor between 'T' and 'e' in "Testing", and hit backspace twice.  The
rest of the text will go into the last cell.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether this is a bug that can be upstreamed or not, because
the comment in the code specifically mentions that this is the intended
behavior, and has been since at least 2007.  However, we changed this behavior
in our product to match what Firefox does, which is to make the second
backspace a no-op.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-badquerycommand">bugfix/badquerycommand</a> (Shezan Baig; D32128551)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/badquerycommand.html">this link</a> in Chrome, click
the yellow div and hit <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code> a bunch of times. Then
<code>&lt;shift&gt;</code>+<code>&lt;up&gt;</code> a bunch of times. Each time
you press <code>&lt;up&gt;</code>, the result of
<code>queryCommandValue('bold')</code> changes inconsistently.<p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cellInMulticol">bugfix/cellInMulticol</a> (Shezan Baig; D34079255)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/cellInMulticol.html">this link</a> in Chrome and keep
resizing the window. You will see that the table cells get split when they
reach column boundaries.</p>
<p>This is a rather complicated patch and requires a bunch of additional work
before it can be sent upstream.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cleanWarnings">bugfix/cleanWarnings</a> (Shezan Baig)</h3>
<p>The purpose of this branch is simply to cleanup the ton of compiler warnings
we get when building Chromium in Visual Studio. Most of these warnings are
benign, so we simply just disable them.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-clearDragCaret">bugfix/clearDragCaret</a> (Shezan Baig; D31916022)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/clearDragCaret.html">this link</a> in Chrome, then
select some text from another tab, and try to drag it into the editable div.
Before you drop, you will see a caret at the place where the text should go.
When you drop however, <code>event.preventDefault()</code> is called, so the
text does not get inserted. However, the drag caret remains visible.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cleartypecanvas">bugfix/cleartypecanvas</a> (Shezan Baig; D32281407; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86776">86776</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/cleartypecanvas">this link</a> in Chrome, and notice
that the canvas element does not use ClearType fonts even though
<code>subpixel-antialiased</code> is used.</p> <p>Note that when painting to an
<code>ImageBuffer</code>, Chromium disables ClearType even if it is the default
on the system.  However, in our case, we are explicitly requesting it in the
document, so this change makes Chromium honor the
<code>-webkit-font-smoothing</code> setting if it is requested explicitly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>-webkit-font-smoothing</code> setting has no effect in Windows for Skia.
This is the change that is being tracked upstream by WebKit bug
<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86776">86776</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't disable ClearType on <code>ImageBuffer</code> if it was explicitly requested.
This is not yet being tracked upstream.</p></li>

<h3><a name="bugfix-contractionFix">bugfix/contractionFix</a> (Edward Christie)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cursorContext">bugfix/cursorContext</a> (Shezan Baig; D35952365)</h3>
<p>It is somewhat hard to reproduce, the window height needs to be just about
right.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/cursorContext.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and hit
Enter until the cursor is at the last possible line where the scrollbar does
not appear.  Make sure there is just enough space for about half a line
more.</p>
<p>Now keep typing on this line, letting it word-wrap which causes the scrollbar
to appear.  Keep doing this for a few lines.  You will notice that on some
lines (usually the second or the third, then every alternating line after
that), the scrollbar does not scroll down completely.</p>
<p>In our product, there is an overlay around the RTE of about a couple of pixels.
The purpose of the padding on the contenteditable was to prevent this overlay
from covering the text.  However, since the bottom of the text was right
against the border of the <code>content-editable</code>, this was causing the
descent of some characters to be obscured.</p>
<p>We "fixed" this in this branch by inflating the reveal rect by about half the
cursor height, showing more "context" when moving up and down in a scrollable
contenteditable.  However, a proper fix would be to make the last line scroll
completely, taking the padding into account.  We haven't gotten around to this
yet.</p>

<p>Open <a href="repros/iframeZoom.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and zoom the
page in and out.  The content outside the <code>iframe</code> zooms, but the
content inside the <code>iframe</code> does not zoom.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-imgresample">bugfix/imgresample</a> (Shezan Baig; D32353761)</h3>
<p>The change for this branch is only noticable when the <code><a
        href="#bugfix-svgscale">bugfix/svgscale</a></code> branch has been
applied to make SVG images scale properly.  Therefore, we cannot reproduce the
issue in Chrome until bug <a
    href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85335">85335</a> is fixed
upstream.  However, we can build a <code>test_shell</code> with
<code>bugfix/svgscale</code> merged in to test this.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/svgscale.html">this link</a> in a
<code>test_shell</code> that has been patched with
<code>bugfix/svgscale</code>.  The second icon is using an
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, and the third icon is using an
<code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> element.  Without the
<code>bugfix/imgresample</code> patch, the second icon appears a little fuzzier
than the third icon (you may need to zoom in to the pixel level to notice the
difference).</p>
<p>Once the <code>bugfix/imgresample</code> patch is applied, the second icon
matches the third icon more closely.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-indentpre">bugfix/indentpre</a> (Shezan Baig; D31922188)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/indentpre.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The "Hello"

<p>Open <a href="repros/justifyprewrap.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
second paragraph will not be justified, even though
<code>text-align:justify</code> is specified.</p>
<p>There is an upstream ticket for this issue, but it calls for a much more
comprehensive fix than what was done in this branch.  In this branch, we just
enable the existing justification logic in elements that have
<code>whitespace:pre-wrap</code> specified, but the upstream ticket calls for
modification to the justification logic itself to match how Microsoft Word
software works.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-listMarkerAlignment">bugfix/listMarkerAlignment</a> (Shezan Baig; D37088493; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21709">21709</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/listMarkerAlignment.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
list markers are all left-aligned, even though the second and third
<code>li</code> elements are not.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-listMarkerFont">bugfix/listMarkerFont</a> (Shezan Baig; D32534047)</h3>
<p>Note: This branch has been miscategorized as a bugfix, it is actually a feature
that we wanted specifically for our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch makes it so that the font used for the list marker will be the same
as the first character in the list item.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/listMarkerFont.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The list
item will be selected.  When you click <code>BIGGER</code> or
<code>SMALLER</code> to change the font size, the list marker's font does not
change with it.  In our product, we wanted the list marker's font to match the
first character in the list item.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-listMarkerSelection">bugfix/listMarkerSelection</a> (Shezan Baig; D32422051)</h3>
<p>Note: This branch has been miscategorized as a bugfix, it is actually a feature
that we wanted specifically for our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch makes it so that list markers are not highlighted when the list
item is selected.  This matches the behavior in Firefox and Microsoft Word
software.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/listMarkerSelection.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
Notice that the list markers are highlighted.  Additionally, notice that the
list marker highlight does not honor the <code>::selection</code> background
color specified in the stylesheet.  In our product, we didn't want the list
markers to be highlighted when selected.</p>

<p>Open <a href="repros/noBRAtStartOfPara.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
contents of the table will be selected on load.  Hit the "List" button multiple

<p>On every second click, the table will move down.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-nonWindowContexts">bugfix/nonWindowContexts</a> (Shezan Baig)</h3>
<p>Note: This branch has been miscategorized as a bugfix, it is actually a feature
that we wanted specifically for our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch removes the assumption that every V8 context has a <code>DOMWindow</code>
associated with it.  This is necessary for our product because we have multiple
V8 contexts living in the same process that need to share data with each other.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-nonemptycellbackspace">bugfix/nonemptycellbackspace</a> (Shezan Baig)</h3>
<p>Note: This branch has been miscategorized as a bugfix, it is actually a
feature that we wanted specifically for our product, so it is unlikely that we
will send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch makes it so that hitting <code>&lt;backspace&gt;</code> when the
cursor is at the beginning of a table cell will be a no-op.  The default
behavior in WebKit is to move into the previous cell and start deleting from
there.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/nonemptycellbackspace.html">this link</a> in Chrome,
and put the cursor in the beginning of the second or third cell and start
backspacing.  Note that the issue does not happen when the cell is empty.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-nonemptycelldelete">bugfix/nonemptycelldelete</a> (Shezan Baig)</h3>
<p>Note: This branch has been miscategorized as a bugfix, it is actually a

<p>This branch makes it so that hitting <code>&lt;delete&gt;</code> when the
cursor is at the end of a table cell will be a no-op.  The default behavior in
WebKit is to move into the next cell and start deleting from there.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/nonemptycelldelete.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
put the cursor at the end of the first cell, after the 'c' and start deleting.
The table in the next cell will be highlighted on the first press, and deleted
on the second press.  Note that the issue does not happen when the cell is
empty.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-scrollClipRect">bugfix/scrollClipRect</a> (Shezan Baig; D32861389)</h3>
<p>This bug is somewhat hard to reproduce, the window size needs to be just
about right.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/scrollClipRect.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
resize the window so that new outer scrollbars appear over the existing
scrollbars of the iframe.  Then resize it just a little smaller.  Then use the
mouse wheel to scroll the contents of the iframe.</p>
<p>If the window is sized just right, you will see that only a portion of the
iframe scrolls.  This is because the clipRect is not being calculated correctly
due to the scale transform being applied.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-selectionGapTransform">bugfix/selectionGapTransform</a> (Shezan Baig)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/selectionGapTransform.html">this link</a> in Chrome,
and play around with selection.  For example, use the mouse to select from the
first line of text to the last line of text, then move the mouse back to
unselect.  While playing with it, at some points you will notice that the
selection highlights are not properly being removed when unselecting, and
sometimes the selection highlights don't properly appear at the right time.</p>
<p>This is because the code that fills the gaps between elements does not
handle transforms properly.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-selrectantialias">bugfix/selrectantialias</a> (Shezan Baig; D32113976; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=87157">87157</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/selrectantialias.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  You
will see "gaps" between the lines and the spans on the first line.</p>
<p>The issue is that the selection highlight is drawn for each text run with
anti-aliasing on.  This causes "gaps" to appear around the edges where the
filled rects got blended.  The solution was to simply turn off anti-aliasing
when filling selection rects.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-svgscale">bugfix/svgscale</a> (Shezan Baig; D32353761; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85335">85335</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/svgscale.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  When a SVG
file is used as a css background, or in an <code>img</code> element, it does
not scale properly.  It only scales properly when used in an <code>embed</code>
element.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-tooltip_refresh">bugfix/tooltip_refresh</a> (Shezan Baig; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84375">84375</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/tooltip_refresh.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  Each
line has a tooltip set.  However, when the first tooltip shows up, and you move
the mouse away from it, it doesn't move the tooltip to the element where the
mouse is.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-after_copycut">feature/after_copycut</a> (James McIlhargey)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch fires two new events <code>aftercut</code> and
<code>aftercopy</code> which have read/write access to the clipboard
representation.  This allows us to intercept the state of the clipboard after
WebKit has populated it and make any tweaks.  This is useful for selectively
overriding some copy/paste behaviour with minimal JS code.</p>

<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>We needed extra control over the proxy server configuration that's used by
the <code>SimpleResourceLoaderBridge</code>.  This branch makes it possible to
supply a custom <code>net::ProxyConfigService</code> so we can provide our own
settings</p>

<h3><a name="feature-colorDocumentMarkers">feature/colorDocumentMarkers</a> (Shezan Baig; D32415776)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>We needed extra control of the color of the document markers (i.e. the
squiggly lines for spelling errors etc).  WebKit hardcodes spelling errors to
red, grammar errors to green.  This branch makes it possible for us to specify
the color from the document.</p>
<p>TODO: make this a CSS property instead of a DOM attribute.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-expose-request-context">feature/expose-request-context</a> (Imran Haider)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>We needed support for listing/reading/writing on the local filesystem.  For
the local filesystem writer, we need a reference to the blob storage controller
so that we can get the blob data.  A reference to the blob storage controller
can be retrieved from the <code>TestShellRequestContext</code>.  This commit
makes it possible for us to get a reference to the
<code>TestShellRequestContext</code> from the
<code>SimpleResourceLoaderBridge</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-fontSmoothing">feature/fontSmoothing</a> (Calum Robinson; D36278764)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch adds an API to control the font smoothing selection because the
product relies on its own custom setting and not the OS default.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-indentOutdentBB">feature/indentOutdentBB</a> (Shezan Baig; D36805707, D32177325)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will

<p>This branch adds <code>IndentBB</code> and <code>OutdentBB</code> commands
that make indenting and outdenting of list items behave closer to how it works
in MS Word.</p>
<p>TODO: The code for this is very messy, it needs to be cleaned up.</p>
