<h3><a name="bugfix-backspaceintotable" href="#bugfix-backspaceintotable">bugfix/backspaceIntoTable</a> (Shezan Baig; D32947240)</h3>

<p>Open <a href="repros/backspaceIntoTable.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
put the cursor between 'T' and 'e' in "Testing", and hit backspace twice.  The
rest of the text will go into the last cell.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether this is a bug that can be upstreamed or not, because the
comment in the code specifically mentions that this is the intended behavior,
and has been since at least 2007.  However, we changed this behavior in our
product to match what Firefox does, which is to make the second backspace a
no-op.</p>
