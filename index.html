<h3><a name="bugfix-backspaceIntoTable">bugfix/backspaceIntoTable</a> (Shezan Baig; D32947240)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/backspaceIntoTable.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
put the cursor between 'T' and 'e' in "Testing", and hit backspace twice.  The
rest of the text will go into the last cell.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether this is a bug that can be upstreamed or not, because
the comment in the code specifically mentions that this is the intended
behavior, and has been since at least 2007.  However, we changed this behavior
in our product to match what Firefox does, which is to make the second
backspace a no-op.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-badquerycommand">bugfix/badquerycommand</a> (Shezan Baig; D32128551)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/badquerycommand.html">this link</a> in Chrome, click
the yellow div and hit <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code> a bunch of times. Then
<code>&lt;shift&gt;</code>+<code>&lt;up&gt;</code> a bunch of times. Each time
you press <code>&lt;up&gt;</code>, the result of
<code>queryCommandValue('bold')</code> changes inconsistently.<p>

<p>Open <a href="repros/cellInMulticol.html">this link</a> in Chrome and keep
resizing the window. You will see that the table cells get split when they
reach column boundaries.</p>
<p>This is a rather complicated patch and requires a bunch of additional work
before it can be sent upstream.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cleanWarnings">bugfix/cleanWarnings</a> (Shezan Baig)</h3>
<p>The purpose of this branch is simply to cleanup the ton of compiler warnings
we get when building Chromium in Visual Studio. Most of these warnings are
benign, so we simply just disable them.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-clearDragCaret">bugfix/clearDragCaret</a> (Shezan Baig; D31916022)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/clearDragCaret.html">this link</a> in Chrome, then
select some text from another tab, and try to drag it into the editable div.
Before you drop, you will see a caret at the place where the text should go.
When you drop however, <code>event.preventDefault()</code> is called, so the
text does not get inserted. However, the drag caret remains visible.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cleartypecanvas">bugfix/cleartypecanvas</a> (Shezan Baig; D32281407; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86776">86776</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/cleartypecanvas">this link</a> in Chrome, and notice
that the canvas element does not use ClearType fonts even though
<code>subpixel-antialiased</code> is used.</p> <p>Note that when painting to an
<code>ImageBuffer</code>, Chromium disables ClearType even if it is the default
on the system.  However, in our case, we are explicitly requesting it in the
document, so this change makes Chromium honor the
<code>-webkit-font-smoothing</code> setting if it is requested explicitly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>-webkit-font-smoothing</code> setting has no effect in Windows for Skia.
This is the change that is being tracked upstream by WebKit bug
<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86776">86776</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't disable ClearType on <code>ImageBuffer</code> if it was explicitly requested.
This is not yet being tracked upstream.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="bugfix-contractionFix">bugfix/contractionFix</a> (Edward Christie)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cursorContext">bugfix/cursorContext</a> (Shezan Baig; D35952365)</h3>
<p>It is somewhat hard to reproduce, the window height needs to be just about
right.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/cursorContext.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and hit
Enter until the cursor is at the last possible line where the scrollbar does
not appear.  Make sure there is just enough space for about half a line
more.</p>
<p>Now keep typing on this line, letting it word-wrap which causes the scrollbar
to appear.  Keep doing this for a few lines.  You will notice that on some
lines (usually the second or the third, then every alternating line after
that), the scrollbar does not scroll down completely.</p>
<p>In our product, there is an overlay around the RTE of about a couple of pixels.
The purpose of the padding on the contenteditable was to prevent this overlay
from covering the text.  However, since the bottom of the text was right
against the border of the <code>content-editable</code>, this was causing the
descent of some characters to be obscured.</p>
<p>We "fixed" this in this branch by inflating the reveal rect by about half the
cursor height, showing more "context" when moving up and down in a scrollable
contenteditable.  However, a proper fix would be to make the last line scroll
completely, taking the padding into account.  We haven't gotten around to this
yet.</p>
