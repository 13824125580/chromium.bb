        <h1>Enable AsynchronousSpellCheckEnabled bit, Spellchecker, and AutoCorrection. Assuming the Spellchecker will autocorrect all the 'tst' into 'test'. Now type really fast in the DIV[contenteditable] below. Make sure 'tsts' is typed multiple times.  Note that the caret position should always be at the end of this text flow.  Due to a bug in Editor, this could break when user types fast because it would reset the caret position after a replacement under some cases.</h1>
