This document was produced by the CSS Working Group as a Candidate Recommendation.

A Candidate Recommendation is a document that has been widely reviewed and is ready for implementation. W3C encourages everybody to implement this specification and return comments to the (archived) public mailing list www-style@w3.org (see instructions). When sending e-mail, please put the text “css3-multicol” in the subject, preferably like this: “[css3-multicol] …summary of comment…”

Publication as a Candidate Recommendation does not imply endorsement by the W3C Membership. This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite this document as other than work in progress.

This document was produced by a group operating under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy. W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which the individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy.

This document has been a Working Draft in the CSS Working Group for several years. Multi-column layouts are traditionally used in print. On screen, multi-column layouts have been considered experimental, and implementation and use experience was deemed necessary in order to proceed. Several implementations have occurred over the past years, and this specification incorporates useful feedback from implementors as well as authors and users.

The specification was updated in April 2011 to correct a contradiction between the text and the pseudo-algorithm in section 3.4. The pseudo-algorithm was corrected and also made easier to read. The wording of a few other sections was improved in places, without changes to the functionality.

This document will remain Candidate Recommendation at least until 12 May 2011. See the CR exit criteria.
